PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/control_unit/y_mux_ctrl_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/control_unit/y_mux_ctrl_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/control_unit/y_mux_ctrl_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/key_expansion/ram/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/key_expansion/ram/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[6] (net: design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/key_expansion/ram/address_in[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/aes_0/inst/aes/decryption_module/counter/reg_Q_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-181#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (design_1_wrapper/design_1_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
